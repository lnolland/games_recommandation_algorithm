# Games_Recommendation_Algorithm

## Introduction:
In this project, I made a game recommendation algorithm which works like this:<br>
1. The algorithm get the user's inputs
2. The algorithm access the database we made
3. The algorithm compare each game in the database to the input
4. The algorithm assign a score to each game depending of the number of common points they have
5. The algorithm return the games with the best scores

We can break down the making of the algorithm in 4 parts:<br><br>
1. Getting the data and clean it
2. Store the data somewhere we can access it
3. Make an algorithm to compare games and find equivalents
4. Access the data with the algorithm and provide an output to the user's inputs


## 1 Getting the data and clean it:
Firstly, we need to find an API to collect the data we will use. In this project, I used the rawg API, you can make your own profile and get your own key to access to the API here: https://rawg.io/apidocs. Now we need to get the data and clean it, here is the code I made to get and clean the data:

## 2 Store the data somewhere we can access it:
